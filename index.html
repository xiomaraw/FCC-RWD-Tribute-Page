    <h2>Who is she?</h2>
    <p> My mother, Letricia Crystal Dockery-Watler, was a phenomenal and well-rounded woman. 
	    According to her resume, she was "an innovative professional with over ten years of extensive public and government relations experience. 
	    Who possessed operational experience in both administrative functions and human services." However, my mother was more than that. 
	    This woman started a lunchtime knitting club at the Manhattan Borough President Office that connected over ten different agencies within Manhattan. 
	    She brought issues such as sexual harassment in the workplace, gender pay gap, and discrimination. 
	    She received a citation from former Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger for outstanding community outreach and academic achievement during her tenure at Manhattan Borough President Office. 
	    Letricia completed her Masters of Public Administration at Long Island University during nine months pregnant with her daughter Xiomara. 
	    Letricia was so in love with her daughter; she did not go back to work until her child can talk and tell her what happened at school, which took four years. 
	    Unfortunately, Letricia Watler passed away on July 23, 2008, from Adult T Cell Lymphoma leaving her husband, Carlton, and her only child, Xiomara. 
	    I am developing this website as a tribute to my mom for teaching me to be a kind, empathetic, and fearless woman. 
	    To find out what her daughter has been up to, add her on <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiomarawatler" target="_blank">LinkedIn!</a></p>
